# metamorphosis

A minimalist implementation of morphology randomization in Isaac Sim. Can be used with or without IsaacLab.

## TODO:

- [x] Preliminary implementation.
- [x] `QuadrupedBuilder12Dof` and `QuadrupedBuilder16Dof`.
- [ ] A minimal RL baseline.  

## Instaillation

Git clone and `pip install -e .`.

## Morphology Randomization

See `scripts/`.

Note that running independently (without IsaacLab) would require installing Open-USD via `pip install usd-core`.
However, IsaacSim uses a custom USD build and is **incompatible** with the one installed via pip.
If you experience IsaacSim errors after `pip install usd-core`, uninstall it.

```python
#QuadrupedBuilder12Dof

#QuadrupedBuilder16Dof
```





**Important**

Remember to set `replicate_physics=False` and `enabled_self_collisions=False`!
